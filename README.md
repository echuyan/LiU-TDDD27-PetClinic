# TDDD27_2023_VetPortal


## Name
This is a project for TDDD27'23 course.
The project aims to create the veterinary clinic web portal.

## Functional Specification
- 1.1 The portal should be accessible for the following types of users (roles):
    - pet owners
    - veterinary doctors
    - administrators
    Each role has its own priviliges and different UI functions available.
- 1.2 Pet owners can see and edit their pets profiles, add new pets and make an appointment to one of the doctors for a chosen pet according to a calendar of doctor's availability.
- 1.3 Doctors can search for and view pets information, make appointments, create new health records.
- 1.4 Administrators are considered to be both system administrators (thus they can create new doctors profile and grant them access) and clinic admins (create new pets/owners, appointments, bills, etc). In real life those would be two different roles, so this is just a simplification.
- 1.5 Some of the events should generate notification emails (e.g. new appointment).
- - `#F00`1.6 -only if have time- Possibility of conducting a video call between a doctor and an owner.

## Technical Specification
2.1 Frontend: React.js
2.2 Backend: Node.js + Express.js
2.3 Database: MongoDB or SQLite
